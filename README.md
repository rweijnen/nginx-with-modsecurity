# nginx-with-modsecurity-rpi
NGINX build with modsecurity incl OWASP rules and other nginx modules I use on Raspberry Pi 5

Includes the following modules:
GeoIP2
Subs filter
Headers more

Also changes the NGINX indentifiers which make it slightly harder to detect webserver type and version

Images are on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/rweijnen/nginx-with-modsecurity/general)
